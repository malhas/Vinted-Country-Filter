## [1.4.14] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Adds an API recovery watchdog that retries real visible/queued item endpoints with backoff instead of relying on a raw synthetic API page.
- Adds a **Retry API now** button to the access-paused warning so users can manually kick recovery without opening API URLs or needing external debugging.

## [1.4.13] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed
- Uses the item that actually triggered the access-block pause when polling for API recovery, instead of the synthetic `/api/v2/items/1/details` endpoint that can stay blocked by Cloudflare/Helium while real item lookups already work.

## [1.4.12] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed
- Avoids falsely pausing with the API blocked/captcha warning when an individual item returns a plain `403` response.
- Captcha polling now waits only while the response actually looks like a challenge/access block, so the script can recover when the old probe endpoint returns a non-challenge `403`.

## [1.4.11] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed
- Sends credentials and JSON `Accept` headers on per-item Vinted API lookups so extension-based userscript managers like Helium do not drop the logged-in session when fetching seller location details.

## [1.4.10] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed
- Avoids showing the captcha/API-paused warning for a single item that returns `403` while the general item API is still healthy.
- Marks only that item as unavailable and continues processing the rest of the catalog.

## [1.4.9] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed
- Prevented captcha/access-block handling from automatically opening `/api/v2/items/1/details`, which could hijack the main Vinted tab in browsers that block or redirect popups.
- The script now pauses on 403 responses, shows the captcha/access warning, and polls until API access is restored.

## [1.4.8] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed
- Updated startup detection for Vinted's current header markup so the script no longer exits unless a visible/current login button is detected.
- Removed the old English-only blocker; country names are now normalized across supported Vinted locales.
- Cleaned newer `@match` metadata entries so userscript managers read only the URL pattern.

## [1.4.7] - 2026-01-29

### Changed
- Improved language detection for determining if Vinted is set to English:
  - Prefer the HTML source (`<html lang="...">`) and `meta` tags with `content` values that are `en` or start with `en` (e.g., `en`, `en-US`).
  - Fallback to the `?locale=...` URL parameter when necessary.
  - Removed brittle DOM text-based heuristics in favor of stable source attributes.

## [1.4.6] - 2026-01-29

### Added
- Do not show the "You must be logged in" warning on API pages (URLs containing `/api/`) to avoid showing the banner when visiting API endpoints directly.
- Expanded the list of countries in **Settings > Include Countries** to include full country names commonly used on Vinted (e.g., **United Kingdom**, **Ireland**, **Austria**, **Czech Republic**, etc.). Country names are normalized internally for reliable matching.

### Changed
- Bumped version to **1.4.6** and updated release date to **Jan 29, 2026**.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-01-17

### Added
- **Fully automatic captcha handling** - No manual intervention needed
  - Popup opens automatically when 403 is detected
  - Automatically checks for 200 status every 1.5 seconds
  - Popup closes automatically when captcha is solved
  - Retry logic ensures popup closes reliably
- Split the menu into **Main** and **Settings** tabs with persistent active tab across sessions
- Added a subtle fade/slide animation when switching tabs for smoother UX

### Changed
- Removed manual "Reopen Captcha Popup" and "Resume Manually" buttons
- Simplified captcha warning to show auto-solve status only
- Improved popup blocker detection and error handling

## [1.4.1.1] - 2026-01-10

### Changed
- Removed duplicates count/stat from the UI to prevent confusion.
- Duplicate detection badges remain; only the stats panel counter was removed.
