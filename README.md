## 📦 Installation

1. Install a userscript manager:
   - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
   - [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
   - [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) (Firefox)

2. **[Click here to install the script](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/559753-vinted-country-city-filter-client-side)** from Greasy Fork

   *Or* create a new script and paste the contents of `code.js`

3. Visit any supported Vinted site and start browsing!

## 🎯 How It Works

1. The script scans visible items on the page
2. For each item, it first checks cached location data, then fetches from Vinted's API if needed
3. Location data is cached forever to avoid repeated API calls
4. Country flags are added to item cards
5. Use the floating panel to filter by your preferred country
6. Non-matching items fade out, keeping your focus on relevant listings

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Language**: The script normalizes country names across supported Vinted locales
- **Rate Limits**: The script respects Vinted's API limits.
- **Visual Only**: Filtering is purely visual — it doesn't affect Vinted's search results
